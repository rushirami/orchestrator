# CI quality gates

> For maintainers. Using T3 Code? See [docs/user](../user/).

[`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](../../.github/workflows/ci.yml) runs these quality gates on pull requests
and pushes to `main`:

- **Check**: `vp check` (format and lint; this repo sets `typeCheck: false` in its lint options),
  then `vpr typecheck` for the workspace type check. The same job
  builds the desktop pipeline (`vp run build:desktop`) and verifies the preload bundle exists and
  uses only imports that Electron's sandbox can load. The verifier parses imports, then executes the
  trusted artifact with controlled bridge stubs to confirm that its required APIs are callable.
- **Test**: `vp run test` across the workspace.

[`.github/workflows/windows-tests.yml`](../../.github/workflows/windows-tests.yml) is a manual
Windows lane (`workflow_dispatch` only) on a Blacksmith Windows 2025 runner. The suite does not
pass on Windows yet, so it is not a required check; it exists so the work to get there can be
iterated against a real Windows box without one on hand. Dispatch it with `gh workflow run
windows-tests.yml --ref <branch>`, optionally with `-f package=<dir>` to run one workspace package
and `-f files="<paths>"` to run specific test files inside it. Once it is green, fold it into
`ci.yml`.

Inherited publishing automation is removed. See [local artifact builds](../operations/release.md).
